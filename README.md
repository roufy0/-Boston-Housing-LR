# Linear Regression — From Scratch vs Scikit-Learn

This project demonstrates how to implement **Linear Regression from scratch using Python and NumPy**, and compares it with the **built-in implementation from Scikit-Learn**.

We use the **Boston Housing dataset** to predict housing prices based on numerical features like crime rate, average number of rooms, etc.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the math behind linear regression
- Implement it manually using matrix operations
- Train a regression model using `sklearn`
- Evaluate and compare both approaches

## Dataset

- **Boston Housing Dataset**
- 506 samples × 14 features
- Target variable: `medv` (Median house value)

Dataset source: [Selva86 GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/selva86/datasets/master/BostonHousing.csv)

##  Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

##  Project Structure

1. **Load and explore the dataset**
2. **Split** data into training and testing
3. **Manual implementation** of linear regression:
   - Cost function (MSE)
   - Gradient descent
4. **Scikit-learn regression model**
5. **Performance comparison**
